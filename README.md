# House_price_prediction 
Predict price of house using Linear regression

# Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

There are two files for training and testing data, namely, 'housingtrain.py' and 'housingtest.py' used for execution of linear regression. The file 'Housing.csv' contains all the data regarding house such as size,bedrooms,bathrooms etc. 

First we will train the data by executing 'housingtrain.py' file.
This will ultimately create a trained model, which can be used for prediction in test file.
Then use this trained model along with test data and it will show the resultant output.

# Prerequisites
 Require following libraries along with Python:
 
Scikit-learn,
Numpy,
Pandas,
Pickle

# Installing

These libraries are avilable in pypi. Hnece it can be downloaded and installed with pip as follows:

pip install sklearn

pip install numpy

pip install pandas

pip install pickle

# Deployment
First Run the program 'housingtrain.py'

then run the program 'housingtest.py'
after running thi program, enter the details of house.

And the predicted price of house will be shown as output.
